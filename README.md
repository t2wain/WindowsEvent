## Collecting data from Windows Event Log using EventLogReader class

Recently, I have a need to automate the collection of log data on a regular interval from the Windows Event Log generated by an application. I have implemented the logic as a library so that it can be reused in future projects.

## WinLogParam class

This class allows you to specify the criteria for reading the logs such as :
- Log name
- XPath filter (a feature of the Windows Event Log, see docs)
- Message filter using regular expression
- External log file (.evtx)
- Either read from the Windows Event Log or from a log file

Once you have configured the class, you can run many of the extension methods to read / export the logs. Please review the unit test for some examples.

## Architecture for automating the collection of log data from multiple remote servers

I developed a web service for use by a console app. The console app is deployed to three remote servers and configured to run as a schedule task.

The console app will call the web service to request an XPath filter for exporting (using wevtutil) the next incremental set of windows event data to a log file. Next, it will copy the log file to a central network folder. Finally, it will call the web service which will read the recently exported log file and save the data to a database.
